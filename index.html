        <p>Hello, and thank you for visiting my website. My name is Adam. I'll be using this page as a portfolio to show my work as a web designer. First let me tell you a little about myself.</p>
        <p>I was born and raised in Northern Maine. I have three siblings, two of which I share the same birthday with, but do <strong>not</strong> share the same birth year. The chances of that randomly happening are 1 in 48,627,125. That's my go to ice breaker, but why did I decide to start coding?</p>
        <p>Since I was young I've always been interested in coding due to being interested in how video games work. I felt that web design would be a great start to learning to code, and also have a real world application. It's been a lot of fun learning how HTML and CSS work. I hope you enjoy my site as much as I did making it.</p>
